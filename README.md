## Hi there 👋

**Who I Am:**
I’m Ifeanyi, a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)–focused professional with a business management background. My approach centers on translating security and operational risk into clear, defensible business decisions that leadership can act on.

**What I’m Working On:**
I’m currently building cyber risk and GRC case studies that focus on practical risk assessments, gap analysis, and control mapping. These projects are designed to mirror real-world organizational scenarios and demonstrate how risk findings inform governance and decision-making.

**Tools, Frameworks, and Certifications:**

My work is grounded in NIST CSF and RMF concepts and ISO 27001–aligned principles, with hands-on use of risk registers, heat maps, control testing, and gap analysis. I hold the CompTIA Security+ and Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt certifications and primarily use Excel- and documentation-driven workflows to support analysis and reporting.

**Facts About Me:**

I’m a former NCAA Division I and Division II football player, which shaped how I approach work today. I’m comfortable in high-pressure, high-accountability environments and bring an athlete’s mindset to GRC—preparation, discipline, and consistent execution. That background naturally aligns with risk ownership, governance, and operating within defined controls.
